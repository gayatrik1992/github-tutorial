Individual tree segmentation using multi-temporal UAS data



Description:

This study analyzes the UAV data collected on the gridded forest genetic trial sites for phenotyping established in British Columbia (BC) in 2003. Several drone flights over the years of 2022 and 2023 were conducted on these trial sites, collecting multispectral, LiDAR, and thermal data. This study seeks to explore the application of Individual Tree Segmentation (ITS) algorithms over multi-temporal Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) data collected over these experimental sites in BC. The objective of this project is to compare various individual tree segmentation (ITS) algorithms on a time-series data set and evaluate their accuracy against the field measurements, including stem-mapped plots. We will also explore the opportunities, challenges, and limitations of applying these segmentation algorithms over the multi-temporal nature of the datasets, including but not limited to the changes in the acquisition parameters such as flight altitude and point density.
